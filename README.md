# FingerStorm
A small game that tests hand speed. Made in junior high school.

# Notice
This game was developed during **2015 summer** when I was a junior high school student. The technology used in the project is inevitably outdated. The server has stopped renewing, so the oneline service including ranking records is no longer functioning properly. 

# Introduction

FingerStorm is different from other colorful games, it is based on the main color of black and white, giving people a bright look.

***Comment seven years later in 2022:***
In fact, at that time I this game was trying to make people pay attention to the color weak and blind groups. The game started with only black and white, and gradually introduced more and more colors, and finally a colorful and beautiful world appeared. In this way to show the blind in modern medical treatment, gradually discover color, discover the beauty of the world. Unfortunately, I only made it to the third level and did not go backwards because of time and technical reasons.
